# [Useful Toolz](https://useful-toolz.vercel.app/)

This website contains useful tools which you might just use everyday, ranging from web developer tools to simple arithmetic tools. This section used to be part of my [website](https://www.kudadam.com) but I decided to separate it into it's own website to ease development on it.
